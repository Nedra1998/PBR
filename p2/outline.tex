In practice the renderer is organized into several steps, these steps are
briefly outlined below, and the structure diagram is in
Figure.\ref{fig:p2_outline}.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textit{User} These are the parts of the process that are defined and
    controlled by the user. These stages in the process only interact with the
    camera's view, and the renderer.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \textit{Arguments} These are the command line arguments specified by the
        user at runtime.
      \item \textit{Scene} This is the scene definition script defined by the user.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item \textit{Camera} These processes control and alter the camera in the
    scene.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \textit{View} This controls the cameras view, including its
        position, orientation, and projection.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item \textit{Renderer} This is the core process of the renderer. It handles
    constructing the scene, spawning the subprocesses and constructing the
    output files.
  \item \textit{RenderTile} This process is the core of the renderer, it
    handles detecting the intersections, processes the shading, and spawning
    recursive rays to march.
  \item \textit{RayMarch} This process detects the nearest intersection point
    of a ray in the scene, it is integral for the ray marching to function.
  \item \textit{Object} These stages are defined for every object, and define
    what the object is, these are the core of the ray marching process.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \textit{Distance} This is the core part of \textit{Ray Marching},
        this function defines the distance from any point to the given object.
      \item \textit{Normal} This is simply used to numerically approximate the
        normal of the surface of an object at a given point.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item \textit{Shader} These stages define the look of each object, and are at
    the core of the path tracing process.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \textit{Sample} This stage is used to greatly improve the
        efficiency of path tracing, is selects the reflected/refracted ray
        based upon importance sampling from the material definition.
      \item \textit{Evaluate} This process evaluates the color of light
        traveling along the view ray, due to the sampled incident ray.
    \end{enumerate}
