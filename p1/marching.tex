After the ray has been case from the observer, then next step is to determin
what object it hits in the scene, if any. This process is the core the any path

In most ray tracing or path tracing systems, the prefered implementation is to
use a ray tracer. The method that Specula uses is build off of the basis of a
ray tracer, so we will explain that first.
