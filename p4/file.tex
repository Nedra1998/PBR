\section{Scene File}%
\label{sec:scene_file}

All of the scene files are scripted using Lua. All of Lua's syntax is
applicable to the scene definitions. In addition to any standard Lua libraries,
Specula also provides additional types and functions. These functions and types
are what should be used to construct the scene specification.
