## Literate Programming

Literate programming is a system where the documentation and the code are
written in a single document, then a tool extracts and formats the
documentation, and a different tool extracts and compiles the code.

Each function can be deconstructed into fragments of the form ``<Fragment
Name>``. Then these fragments can be referenced later in book.

```
<Function Defintions> ==
  void InitGlobals() {
    <Initalize Global Variables>
  }
```

Then later in the documentation, when the variables are defined, we can then
write

```
<Initalize Global Variables> == size = 13;
```

Then when another variable is defined, we are able to append that variable into
the fragment like so

```
<Initalize Global Variables> += value = true;
```

Most of the code in the book is decomposed in this way, to produce more
readable documentation.

### Indexing and Cross-Referencing

Indices in the page margins give page numbers where the functions, variables and
methods are defined. Induces at the end of the book collect all of these
identifiers so that it is possible to find definitions by name.
